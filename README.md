 Code and data for the paper "Two dynamic programming approaches for finding optimal and Nash equilibrium harvesting strategies in predator-prey systems"
 
 Version: 02.11.2022
 
For extensive search approach use "Extensive search analysis".
- After loading script in R you can use the available functions to run the analysis in command line
- Decription of each function is available in code
- Parameters and output file names are passed as parameters in the functions
- Use CSV files with the parameters (available in the folder) for the analysis

For interpolation method use "pred_prey_interp.R" for social optimum and "pred_prey_game_interp.R" for Nash equilibrum
- Parameters and output file names are hard coded and have to be changed for subsequent analyses

All output files are stored in Data folder. It cointains "paper_plots.R" script file that translates output data into figures used in the paper.
NOTE: Input and output file names in paper_plots.R are hard coded and may need to be changed with subsequent analysis
